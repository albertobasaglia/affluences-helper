# Biblioteca Reserver
Have you ever felt an uncontrollable urge to claim your favorite seat in your
favorite library for an entire week?

Well, here it is: this utterly unnecessary script that I spent 2 hours making
instead of studying (which, let’s be honest, explains the bugs I heroically
ignored). Now, you too can reserve your spot with the precision of a
laser-guided procrastinator!

## Disclaimer
This script is purely for educational purposes (translation: if you use it,
you’re on your own). By running this code, you acknowledge that any
consequences, disasters, or awkward library confrontations are entirely your
responsibility.

Oh, and one more thing: Please be a decent human being. Respect the other
library guests and don’t reserve slots you’re not actually planning to use.
Seriously, nobody likes an empty chair hoarder. Use responsibly—or don’t. I’m
not your parent.
